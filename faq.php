              <ul class="index-list">
                <li><h6 class="index-list-question">Is there a "catch" or any hidden fees associated with your advertised price?</h6></li>
                  <p class="index-list-answer">
                    No! Our Advertised 1/4 Acre Prices actually include lot sizes that are slightly larger than .25 acre. The only limitations to our service are noted in the Terms and Conditions at the bottom of the Sign Up Page. To view our pricing for other lots sizes, please see our Services Page. 
                  </p>
                <li><h6 class="index-list-question">Is your advertised price an "introductory price?" Do you plan to raise your prices in the future?</h6></li>
                  <p class="index-list-answer">
                    No! We do not plan to raise our prices BUT, IF WE EVER DO, WE WILL POST ANY CHANGE ON OUR WEB SITE. PLEASE NOTE THAT OVERSEEDING PRICES COULD INCREASE AS THE COST OF FUEL DIRECTLY AFFECTS SEED PRICES. AGAIN, ANY CHANGES TO OUR PRICES WILL BE POSTED ON OUR WEB SITE BUT IT IS NOT OUR INTENT TO INCREASE OUR PRICING STRUCTURE. 
                  </p>
                <li><h6 class="index-list-question">While your prices are excellent, someone is offering a cheaper price; are you able to beat it?</h6></li>
                  <p class="index-list-answer">
                    Many, if not all, such offers come from uninsured individuals or companies that are not reporting their payroll and/or employ those who are NOT LEGALLY PERMITTED TO WORK IN THE U.S.   In other words, they are BREAKING THE LAW. We are licensed to operate our business, are FULLY-INSURED, report our payroll, rigorously train our employees and only hire those who are legally permitted to work.   Like most of our Customers, we endeavor to obey our authorities as we provide for our families. When the Consumer hires such individuals/companies, they are ADVERSELY AFFECTING PEOPLE who put forth the effort and expense to run businesses LEGALLY and WITH INTEGRITY. We encourage everyone to consider the long-term economic effect of who they hire over a short-term personal "gain." We are happy to offer Group Discounts. Please see below.

                  <p class="index-list-answer">
                    We will email or call in advance with a Service Schedule.
                  </p>
                <li><h6 class="index-list-question">Do I need to do anything to my lawn before you come?</h6></li>
                  <p class="index-list-answer">
                    Yes ->
                    <ul>
                      <li>1) Please have lawn free of furniture, toys, leashes, dog waste etc. Objects in lawn WILL NOT BE MOVED (so as not to injure our employees or damage your property).

                      <li>2) Mark ALL Lawn Sprinkler Heads (and anything else that is "hidden") WITH PIN FLAGS (PREFERABLY ORANGE). PIN FLAGS ARE SOLD AT HOME IMPROVEMENT STORES IN THE TOOL SECTION.
                      </li>
                      <li>3) YOU CONTROL YOUR AERATION RESULTS.  FOR BEST RESULTS FROM OUR MACHINES, you should SENSIBLY water your lawn at least 24 hours PRIOR TO your Service Date.   DO NOT OVER-WATER!  TURF SHOULD BE MOIST, NOT SATURATED. 
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
                <li><h6 class="index-list-question">What if it rains on my scheduled Service Date?</h6></li>
                  <p class="index-list-answer">
                    We will plan to call or email you with a new Service Schedule.
                  </p>
                <li><h6 class="index-list-question">What type of grass seed do you use?</h6></li>
                  <p class="index-list-answer">
                    We use Premium Turf-type Tall Fescue Grass Seed.   All varieties of Turf-type Tall Fescue are engineered to have a thinner blade, be dark green in color as well as traffic-, shade-, disease- and drought-tolerant.
                  </p>
                <li><h6 class="index-list-question">Do you apply Starter Fertilizer?</h6></li>
                  <p class="index-list-answer">
                    No, the EPA no longer allows commercial companies to apply Starter Fertilizer (which has a high Phosphorous content) unless Soil Test results recommend it.   We could not effectively perform our Service Schedules if we factored-in the necessary time to take soil samples, send them to be analyzed and then wait for the results to be mailed to us.   For this reason, we do not inventory any Starter Fertilizer. 
                  </p>
                <li><h6 class="index-list-question">What is your Organic Fertilizer primarily comprised of?</h6></li>
                  <p class="index-list-answer">
                    Our Premium Organic Fertilizer consists of feather meal, fish meal, bone meal, soybean meal, wheat middlings, methylene urea, ammonium sulfate, ferrous sulfate and potassium sulfate.
                  </p>
                <li><h6 class="index-list-question">What can I expect from Overseeding?</h6></li>
                  <p class="index-list-answer">
                    Overseeding is for lawns in generally GOOD condition and contributes to new growth and a uniform appearance.  Overseeding an existing lawn is NOT re-seeding areas of dead turf and/or bare soil.  While we can give some such areas a little extra attention, we cannot do so if these areas comprise a significant portion of your lawn; in such cases Double-Overseeding is recommended.  If you would like Double-overseeding (AT TWICE THE OVERSEEDING PRICE FOR YOUR LOT SIZE), you may select it on the Sign-up Page.
                  </p>
                <li><h6 class="index-list-question">You Just Overseeded My Lawn, Why Canâ€™t I See Any Seeds?</h6></li>
                  <p class="index-list-answer">
                    In MOST cases, you will NOT be able to see all of the individual seeds due to the lack of contrast in color between the grass seed and the turf. Even on areas of dead turf and bare soil, MOST of the grass seed will be IMPERCEPTIBLE to the naked eye in MOST cases. Another misconception people frequently have concerning Overseeding is that the lawn is supposed to be "blanketed" with grass seed. Turf-type Tall Fescue is a BUNCH-TYPE turfgrass, meaning several blades of grass will sprout from one seed. For this reason, it is not necessary to use exorbitant amounts of seed when Overseeding. Remember, Overseeding is NOT re-seeding. Overseeding is "seeding over" an EXISTING lawn in GENERALLY GOOD condition. WE TAKE GREAT CARE IN MAKING SURE ALL OF OUR OVERSEEDING CUSTOMERS GET A GENEROUS AMOUNT OF SEED ON THEIR LAWNS.
                  </p>
                <li><h6 class="index-list-question">How many times will you go over my lawn with your machines?</h6></li>
                  <p class="index-list-answer">
                    We will Core Aerate all areas of your lawn that are safely accessible by our machines ONE TIME. WE ONLY USE THE HIGHEST QUALITY CORE AERATORS, WHICH EXTRACT CORES APPORXIMATELY EVERY 4 INCHES.
                  </p>
                <li><h6 class="index-list-question">Can I get a discount by having my lawn aerated twice during the same visit?</h6></li>
                  <p class="index-list-answer">
                    Yes.  We can Core Aerate your lawn a second time for half the original price; simply select Double-aeration on the Sign-up Page.
                  </p>
                <li><h6 class="index-list-question">Do You Offer Group Discounts?</h6></li>
                  <p class="index-list-answer">

                  <p style="font-size: 11px">*All Discounts apply only to Core Aeration Services and only to RESIDENTIAL Customers within our Service Area.   Discounts will be deducted from the standard cost of whatever Pricing Schedule each Group Member's Lot Size falls into (IF YOU ARE ORGANIZING A GROUP, please make sure everyone knows that each Group Member will only pay the same amount IF every lot is in the same Pricing Schedule AND if each Group Member requests the same service(s)).  All Group Members must live on the same or adjoining streets.  In order to receive the Group Discount, all Group Members must sign-up individually, type their Group Name in the Comments Box at the bottom of the Sign-up Page and must do business with us at the same visit.  YOU MUST FORM YOUR GROUP BEFORE SIGNING-UP.  EVERYONE IN YOUR GROUP MUST SIGN-UP AT APPROXIMATELY THE SAME TIME TO AVOID CAUSING SCHEDULING PROBLEMS.  WE CANNOT HONOR THE "GROUP DISCOUNTS" PRICE TO THOSE WHO SIGN-UP AFTER WE HAVE ALREADY MADE OUR SERVICE SCHEDULES.  THANK YOU.</p>
                <li><h6 class="index-list-question">Do you offer dethatching services?</h6></li>
                  <p class="index-list-answer">
                    No. Dethatching lawns in our area is almost never necessary. Thatch, 1/2 inch or less, is actually beneficial to a lawn as it protects the root systems of turf during the extreme heat of Summer while still allowing water and nutrients to pass through. Additionally, Core Aeration helps to reduce thatch amounts simply by virtue of what it does: extracting cores of earth, the tops of which are turf, including any thatch present. 
                  </p>
                <li><h6 class="index-list-question">Do you apply Lime to the lawn?</h6></li>
                  <p class="index-list-answer">
                    No. Many lawns that receive Lime do not need it. Applying Lime to such lawns can actually hinder the use of fertilizer and micronutrients by the turf and adversely affect its overall health. TO DETERMINE IF LIME IS RECOMMENDED FOR YOUR LAWN, Loudoun County residents can have a FREE SOIL ANALYSIS performed through the County Extension Office located on Catoctic Circle in Leesburg.
